                </li>
                <li>
                  Intercropping: Planting different crops together can help to
                  promote biodiversity, while also providing mutual benefits for
                  the crops.
                </li>
                <li>

                On-the-ground analyses have provided evidence supporting the
                positive relationship between regenerative agriculture, soil
                health, and water conservation.

                Kheti Virasat Mission, a civil society organization in Punjab,
                conducted a survey of over 350 organic farmers in 2021-22, with
                93.6% reporting an increase in their land’s rainwater-holding
                capacity and a 30-60% decrease in irrigation requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Andhra Pradesh, the Rythu Sadhikara Samstha, a non-profit
                organization, conducted two studies in 2020 comparing the water
                and energy consumption of zero-budget natural farming with
                chemical farming. The studies showed a decrease in irrigation
                frequency and energy consumption with natural farming.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Samaj Pragati Sahyog, a grassroots organization in Madhya
                Pradesh promoting natural pest control methods, conducted field
                trials with 1,000 farmers on over 2,000 hectares of land in
                2016-18 to measure water conservation. Its results, published in
                its 2018-19 annual report, showed that sustainable agricultural
                practices saved almost 15 billion liters of water, with
                replacing water-intensive crops alone saving 5.53 billion
                liters.
