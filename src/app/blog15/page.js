This initiative offers Rs. 10 lakhs in financial support to qualified SC households, enabling them to embark on their own business ventures or entrepreneurial endeavors. This, in turn, opens doors for them to achieve self-sufficiency and enhance their quality of life." />

It is anticipated that this initiative will positively impact more than 20 lakh families within the state in the coming years. This one-time capital assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs per SC family is offered entirely as a grant or subsidy, without the requirement for any bank loans, to enable them to establish income-generating endeavors of their choosing." />
