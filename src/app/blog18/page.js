                  Natural Farming Initiatives: The government plans to introduce
                  1 crore farmers to natural farming over the next two years.
                  This initiative presents a significant opportunity for
                  startups specializing in organic farming solutions,
                  bio-inputs, and sustainable agricultural practices to

                  Development of High-Yield Varieties: The introduction of 109
                  new high-yielding and climate-resilient crop varieties creates
                  a demand for startups engaged in agricultural research and
                  development. Startups focusing on biotechnology and genetics
                  can play a crucial role in developing and commercializing

                  Digital Public Infrastructure: The emphasis on creating a
                  Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for agriculture opens
                  avenues for tech startups. Innovations in data management,
                  farm management software, and precision agriculture
                  technologies can thrive under this initiative, modernizing

                  startups to showcase their organic fertilizers, biopesticides,

                  vegetable production clusters near major consumption centres
                  encourages startups to provide innovative solutions for
                  production, storage, and marketing. Collaborations with farmer

                  Abolition of Angel Tax: The removal of the Angel Tax is a
                  significant relief for startups, particularly in agriculture,
                  as it encourages investment without the burden of additional
