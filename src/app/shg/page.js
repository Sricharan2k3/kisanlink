          Self-help groups (SHGs) are small, voluntary associations of people,
          typically from similar socio-economic backgrounds, who come together
          to save money and provide loans to one another. SHGs are crucial in
          empowering rural communities, particularly women, by promoting
          financial inclusion, enhancing livelihoods, and fostering
          entrepreneurship.

                SHGs are pivotal in establishing micro-enterprises, particularly
                in rural areas where traditional employment opportunities may be
                limited. By forming SHGs, members can pool their resources,
                share knowledge, and access financial support, essential for
                starting and sustaining small businesses.

                    SHGs involved in agriculture and food processing can utilize
                    solar dryers to efficiently dry fruits, vegetables, and
                    other agricultural produce. This not only enhances their
                    production capacity but also allows them to sell dried
                    products at higher prices, thereby increasing their income.

                    Solar dryers help in preserving perishable food items,
                    significantly reducing post-harvest losses. This ensures a
                    more stable income for SHGs by minimizing wastage and
                    maximizing the value of their produce.

                    Solar dryers utilize renewable energy, reducing reliance on
                    fossil fuels and minimizing carbon emissions. This aligns
                    with sustainable development goals and contributes to

                    Operating solar dryers requires technical knowledge, which
                    can be imparted to SHG members through training programs.
                    This skill acquisition can open up further employment
                    opportunities and entrepreneurial ventures for them.

                While SHGs have the potential to drive economic empowerment,

                <li>
                  <strong>Lack of Resources:</strong> Many SHGs struggle with
                  inadequate resources and capital to invest in technology and
                  infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dependence on External Support:</strong> SHGs often
                  rely on NGOs and government programs for training and
                  financial assistance. The withdrawal of support can jeopardize
                  their sustainability.

                  strategies, and financial management can empower SHG members
                  to operate their micro-enterprises successfully.

                  <strong>Financial Support:</strong> Government initiatives and

                  necessary equipment, making the transition to sustainable
                  practices more feasible.

                  their products.
