              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>High Initial Costs:</strong> Acquiring and maintaining
                  modern farming equipment can be expensive, particularly for
                  small-scale farmers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Operating and
                  maintaining machinery requires technical knowledge and skills.
                  Training is essential to ensure safe and efficient use.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                To boost farm mechanization in the country, a special dedicated
                Centrally Sponsored scheme ‘Sub Mission on Agricultural
                Mechanization (SMAM)’ was introduced by the Government of India
                in 2014-15.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under this scheme, financial assistance at 40% to 50% of the
                cost of machines depending on the categories of farmers, is
                provided for the purchase of agricultural machines. Financial
                assistance at 40% of the project cost is also provided to rural
                youth & farmers as an entrepreneur, Cooperative Societies of
                Farmers, Registered Farmers Societies, Farmer Producer
                Organizations (FPOs), and Panchayats for the establishment of
                Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), and Hi-tech hubs of high-value
                agricultural machine (Satish, 2023).

              <SubheadingDescription
                subheading="Key Statistics"
                text="To gain insight into the current status of farm mechanization in India, let’s look at some key statistics:"
              />
              <QuoteComponent quote="According to the World Bank estimates, half of the Indian population will be urban by the year 2050. It is estimated that the percentage of agricultural workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001" />
              <p>
                Thus, there is a need to enhance the level of farm mechanization
                in the country. Due to the intensive involvement of labour in
                different farm operations, the cost of production of many crops
                is quite high (Das, 2023).
              </p>
              <p>
                Withdrawal of agricultural labour affects the farm economy
                either by creating a physical scarcity of labour or through the
                rise in farm wages (Soni & Subrahamanya, 2020). Income
                disparities among agricultural workers in India have undergone a
                significant transformation. In 1950-51, agricultural workers
                earned only half of what they did in 1970-71. The income gap
                continued to widen over the next four decades. However, since
                2010-11, there has been a reversal in this trend, with
                agricultural workers’ income increasing to 29% of their previous
                earnings, primarily due to higher agricultural prices (Chand &
                Singh, 2023).
              </p>
              <p>
                Given the increasing wage demands of the present era, the
                integration of farm mechanization has become a pressing
                necessity for farmers. Mechanization not only enhances
                productivity and diminishes labour-intensive activities, but
                also contributes to elevated yields and income.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  At Kisanlink, we are actively engaged in the mission to make
                  farm mechanization a reality for Indian farmers. With a pilot
                  project already underway in Telangana, Kisanlink is at the
                  forefront of bringing modern agricultural machinery and
                  technologies to the hands of farmers, further contributing to
                  the mechanization drive in the country. This initiative not
                  only aims to enhance farm productivity, but also empower small
                  and marginal farmers with the tools they need to thrive in the
                  ever-evolving agricultural landscape.

                subheading="Conclusion"
                text="Farm mechanization has transformed agriculture from a labour-intensive endeavour into a highly efficient and productive industry. Farmers can increase yields, reduce labour costs, and practice more sustainable agriculture by harnessing the power of machines and technology. However, it is crucial to strike a balance between mechanization and environmental and social considerations to ensure a prosperous and sustainable future for agriculture. As technology continues to advance, the future of farm mechanization holds even greater promise for feeding the growing global population."
